Welcome to WipeDicks, the tool that gives your data the shaft! 

## What's the Big Deal? 8===D

WipeDicks is a high-performance, multi-threaded file and device wiping tool that overwrites your data with a veritable bukkake of ASCII penises. It's designed for secure data erasure with more dick jokes than you can shake a stick at!

## Features (or as we like to call them, "Dick Pics") 8=D

- Securely penetrates your files and devices
- Multi-threaded for maximum pleasure (and performance)
- Recursively wipes directories (because size matters)
- Adjustable number of rounds (for those who need extra stamina)
- Option to wipe free space (leave no trace behind!)
- Humorous ASCII art overwrite patterns (it's not the size of the boat, it's the motion of the ocean)

## Warning (Cock Block Alert!) 8==X

This tool is designed to permanently destroy data. Use with extreme caution, or you might end up with blue balls (i.e., regret).

Always double-check your targets before unleashing our ASCII members upon them.

## Installation (Getting It Up and Running) 8===D~

1. Make sure you've got Rust and Cargo (the only package we care about)
2. Clone this bad boy:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/vxfemboy/wipedicks.git && cd wipedicks
  ```
3. Get it hard... err, built:
  ```bash
  cargo build --release
  ```
4. Find your new toy in `target/release/wipedicks`

## Usage (How to Handle Your Tool) 8====D

#### Basic usage:
Options (Piercings for your command):
- `-r, --recursive`: Go deep into directories
- `-n, --numrounds <ROUNDS>`: How many times you want to go (default: 1)
- `-w, --wipefree`: Clean up afterwards
- `-s, --slow`: Take it slow, big boy

#### Examples:
1. Give a single file the business: 
  ```bash
  ./wipedicks /path/to/file
  ```
2. Go to town on a directory, three times:
  ```bash
  ./wipedicks -r -n 3 /path/to/directory
  ```  
3. Absolutely destroy a device (Good luck pulling out of this one!):
 ```bash
 ./wipedicks /dev/sdX
 ```

## Caution (Wrap It Before You Tap It)

- Always check your target twice, or you might screw the wrong hole
- Wiping entire devices is like unprotected data sex - there's no going back
- Don't run this on system files unless you want your computer to go limp
- This tool is for giggles and learning. For serious business, use protection (i.e., certified tools)

The authors aren't responsible for any data loss or damage. Use at your own risk, you kinky data destroyer!

Remember:
> With great power comes great responsibili-D. 
> Use wipedicks wisely, and may your data always rest in pieces! 8====D~~~
